Dwarf Fortress Craft
=======

This mod intends to serve two purposes: let you play Minecraft in the universe of Dwarf Fortress and serve as a base for exporting your fortresses to Minecraft.

## Goals

The primary goal is to play Minecraft in the *universe* of Dwarf Fortress, not to be Dwarf Fortress. As such when gameplay conflicts between both, it should be adjusted to fit the spirit of Minecraft.

The secondary goal of being used to lossly[^1] represent exported fortresses, this means the block palette and furnitures should remain enough to accurately represent a fortress. The mod supplies an optional resourcepack that restores textures and colors to the Dwarf Fortress look, maybe even the Classic look!

## Contributing

I'm not experienced in modding Minecraft so I'll take all the help I can get!

[1]: The fortress should *look* the same but things like engraving or item quality will be lost. This isn't intended to round-trip.
